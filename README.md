On BUS-SYS (dev-b) write a program to print out to screen the branch code, branch name, branch manager userid and branch manager full name as held on USER.DEFS file. If any of these details are not found then display the text “Unknown”.
Only show TP brand branches that are trading, active, included on internet and are type A. At the end of the report, print out the following line including a count of the number of branches printed. TOTAL NO OF BRANCHES = nnn
No need to write test program - any questions please ask me.


Example expected report:


Branch code = 1234
Branch name = NORTHAMPTON
Branch manager userid = FREDB
Branch manager full name = FRED BLOGGS


Branch code = 4321
Branch name = RUGBY
Branch manager userid = JOHND
Branch manager full name = JOHN DOE


etc. 


etc.


etc.


Branch code = 4444
Branch name = LONDON
Branch manager userid = FANAD
Branch manager full name = FANNY ADAMS


TOTAL NO OF BRANCHES = 678
